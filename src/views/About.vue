    Education is about <span class="underline">teaching</span> and

    Monetization makes STEM learning a task. We believe in the philosophy of
    free discourse and engagement

  <p>A paywall will only limit those who need help the most</p>

  <h2>Khan academy isn't fun</h2>

  <p>Let's be real, when was the last time you posted memes in Khan academy?</p>
  <p>
    Khan academy is a great learning center, not for socialization and having a
    place to talk
  </p>

  <h2>Smaller events, finding talents</h2>

  <h3>
    As organizations grow, they forget one key aspect of their identity:
    tight-knit community
  </h3>

  <p>
    Our server has definitely gone through that phase. Yet, we continue our
    pursuit to offer room for smaller groups.

  <h1>In some aspects, our Discord is maintained like a university</h1>

  <p>
    While abiding the strict rules, we also encourage others to hold it as their
    own standards. We have a ban appeal server for we believed in reformed
    members. Our server is as public as possible and offers great transparency,
    by storing most of our information in GitHub since 2019
    <a href="https://git.stem.help/public">https://git.stem.help/public</a>. All
    of these workings reflect our philosophy in education
  </p>

  <h1>We value feedback</h1>

  <p>
    <a href="https://disboard.org/server/493173110799859713"
      >Reviews on Disboard</a
    >, suggestions in #issues-and-suggestions, issues in GitHub and pull
    requests created by members are always reviewed. We recently implemented a
    Kanban system in <a href="https://issues.stem.help">issues.stem.help</a> in
    2021, and hope to make it partially public soon
